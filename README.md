## 👨‍💻 **About Me & My SQL Journey**

Hello! I’m **Oladosu Ibrahim Adeniyi**, a results-oriented **Data Analyst and SQL Developer** with a background in **Accounting and Finance**. My journey into SQL began from a genuine curiosity to uncover the **stories hidden in raw data**—and has since evolved into a passion for **data exploration, transformation, and storytelling** using **Structured Query Language (SQL)** as my primary tool.

Over time, I’ve honed my SQL skills through **real-world projects**, **business case studies**, and **industry datasets**, spanning areas like **sales, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and e-commerce**. I’ve worked extensively with **relational databases** like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, and used SQL to:

* Clean and preprocess raw datasets,
* Perform complex multi-table joins and aggregations,
* Optimize query performance with indexing and CTEs,
* Create views and stored procedures for reusable analysis,
* Build reporting layers for dashboards in Power BI and Excel.

As a certified Power BI Data Analyst Associate and Microsoft Azure Data Engineer, I regularly integrate SQL with **BI tools**, **cloud platforms**, and **Python-based pipelines** to deliver robust, scalable data solutions.

SQL isn’t just a language to me—it’s a **problem-solving mindset**. Whether it's generating KPIs for stakeholders, building ETL workflows, or identifying business trends, I use SQL to bridge the gap between **data** and **decision-making**.
